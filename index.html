  {
    q: "Where did you first meet?",
    a: {
      saira: "We didn’t meet gently. I stepped into traffic for a photograph, and he nearly ran me over. There were headlights, brakes, rain on the road — and his voice, sharp and unamused. I remember the irritation first. The way he looked at me like I was a problem. But beneath it… something sparked that neither of us understood.",
      aayan: "She walked into the road without looking. I slammed the brakes harder than I’ve ever had to. She should have been shaken — but she argued instead. Bold. Annoying. Completely unafraid of me. I told myself it was just frustration. It wasn’t."
    }
  },
  {
    q: "What did you first notice?",
    a: {
      saira: "I noticed how controlled he was. Even angry, he didn’t raise his voice — he just sharpened it. He looked at me like I was reckless, inconvenient. But there was something else in his eyes too — something calculating, almost curious. And that unsettled me more than the anger did.",
      aayan: "I noticed that she wasn’t intimidated. Most people step back when challenged. She stepped closer. Even with a twisted ankle, she refused to yield. There was defiance in her — not loud, not dramatic — just steady. And I wasn’t used to that."
    }
  },
  {
    q: "When did you start feeling he might be the one?",
    a: {
      saira: "It wasn’t in Mumbai. That was just fire. It was in Venice. We were walking without speaking, the canals quiet around us, and for the first time I wasn’t arguing with him. I was just… at ease. That frightened me more than the chaos ever had.",
      aayan: "I don’t believe in 'the one.' I believe in discipline, in clarity. But there was a moment when I stopped calculating and just watched her. She was laughing — unguarded, unaware that I was noticing the way she softened when she forgot to defend herself. That was when I realised she was no longer temporary."
    }
  },
  {
    q: "Who admitted their feelings first?",
    a: {
      saira: "I felt it first, but he was the one who said it. Though he had been carrying it just as long. I think he needed certainty before he allowed himself to be vulnerable.",
      aayan: "I did. But I think she knew before I did. I tend to weigh words before I let them go. Once I say something, I don’t take it back."
    }
  },
  {
    q: "Which was the first city you were together in?",
    a: {
      saira: "As a couple, it wasn’t Mumbai. It was our trip through Manali, Spiti, and Shimla. Five days that were meant to be brief — but stretched longer than we expected. Somewhere between the cold air and the quiet roads, the tension eased. That was the first time it felt like we were choosing each other.",
      aayan: "The first time we were truly together was during that trip through Manali, Spiti, and Shimla. It wasn’t planned as something significant. But distance from the city changed the way we moved around each other. We stayed two extra days. I don’t extend time for things that don’t matter."

      q: "Were you ever afraid of loving her?",
