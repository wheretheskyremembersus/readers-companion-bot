    for: "This story finds people who have felt something deeply and didn’t know what to do with it. The ones who replay conversations long after they’ve ended. If you’ve ever stood between love and fear — you already understand us.",

    for: "It’s for those who believe feelings can wait — until they realise they can’t. For people who have chosen responsibility over vulnerability, and wondered about the cost later. If you’ve ever hesitated when it mattered most, this story will feel familiar.",
